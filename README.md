# ColabChat

ColabChat is a personal chat application powered by a large language model (LLM) and designed to run directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). This interactive notebook lets you experiment with LLM-based conversations and can be customized to fit your personal or research needs.

## Overview

ColabChat provides a simple yet powerful interface to interact with an LLM within a Colab environment. It is perfect for:
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in natural language conversations with the model.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Experiment with language models without local installations.
- **Educational Demos**: Learn about LLMs and chatbot integration using Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: No installation required—just open the notebook in Google Colab.
- **Interactive Interface**: Chat with a personal LLM directly in your browser.
- **Customizable Code**: Modify the notebook to suit your own needs or integrate with different models.
- **Cloud-Based**: Leverage Colab’s free compute resources for quick experimentation.
